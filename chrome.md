Tips regarding using Chrome in Mac.

I particularly find really dangerous to accidentally press Cmd+Q.
A way to disable this is:
System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts:
Application: Google Chrome.app
Menu title: About Google Chrome (or anything else you may want to open, this text represents the name of what you want to open from the app menu, the top bar)
Key Shortcut: press Cmd+Q.

You can also do this for example for Option+Cmd+W that closes all the open tabs.
