Tips regarding using Chrome in Mac.


⇧+Delete: delete the overlayed entry of the auto-complete fields history.
⇧+Fn+Delete: delete an entry from the auto-complete in the URL bar.


I particularly find really dangerous to accidentally press ⌘Q. A way to disable this is:
- Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts
- **Application**: Google Chrome.app

- **Menu title**: 'About Google Chrome' (or anything else you may want to open, this text represents the name of what you want to open from the app menu, the top bar)
- **Key Shortcut**: press ⌘Q.

You can also do this for example for ⌘⌥W that closes all the open tabs.
I think in OS X you can't map two keyboard shortcuts to the same menu. So you can remap ⌘⌥W to 'Downloads', for example.
